# library-system
A lightweight web-based Library Shelf Management System built using Python (Flask) and SQLite. Designed for departmental book-tracking at IIT Kanpur, this app allows storing book names, authors, shelf &amp; section positions, deleting records, and exporting book lists as CSV — all without requiring internet, admin access, or system installation.
